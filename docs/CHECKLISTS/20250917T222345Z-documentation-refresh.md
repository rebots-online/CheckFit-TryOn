# Documentation & Roadmap Refresh Checklist (2025-09-17T22:23:45Z)
- [x] Create architecture narrative at `docs/ARCHITECTURES/20250917T222345Z-architecture.md` capturing current AST, gaps, and proposed billing extensions.
- [x] Generate PlantUML diagram at `docs/ARCHITECTURES/20250917T222345Z-architecture.uml` covering existing modules plus billing additions.
- [x] Generate Mermaid diagram at `docs/ARCHITECTURES/20250917T222345Z-architecture.mmd` mirroring the AST relationships.
- [x] Update `README.md` with:
  - [x] **Architecture Overview** summarizing the app flow and referencing the new diagrams.
  - [x] **Codebase Commentary** highlighting strengths, weaknesses, and technical debt (state management, observability, etc.).
  - [x] **Roadmap** section incorporating the staged plan (foundations, design system, billing, experience, observability, deployment).
  - [x] **Billing Integration Requirements** detailing the universal microsaas pack connector, RevenueCat + Lightning strategy, entitlement model, and connector interface obligations.
  - [x] **UX Enhancement Vision** describing visually appealing upgrades (design system, background scenes, motion design) and linking to relevant proposed modules.
- [x] Verify new docs folder structure (`docs/ARCHITECTURES`, `docs/CHECKLISTS`) is referenced in README so future agents can locate assets.

✅ Checklist complete – no tests required for documentation-only update.
